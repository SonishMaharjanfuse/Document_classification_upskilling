## Data Understanding

There are different types of data that can be used for feature extraction. We studied the different formats of data like pdf, docx, tiff, png, jpeg, and so on. The formats jpeg, png, tiff are the format types for the images, whereas docx, txt are used for text type. The pdf can contain both text and images.

## Data Collection

For the document classification, we collected images for each class (passport, citizenship, license, others) from Google. We performed various image preprocessing techniques such as wrapping, rescaling, resizing, adding noise, image enhancement using equalization, and performing geometric transformations for the images. About 30, 23, and 28 data points were collected from Google for citizenship, license, and passport respectively.
